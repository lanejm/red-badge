Welcome to GiftTag! 

INTRODUCTION
------------

This app is a way for you to keep track of all the gifts you have received over the years in one location.  No more writing things down in a notebook or piece of paper, only to lose that item somewhere in your residence! One can also keep track of what gifts were received on which holidays. 

You can visit the working version here [gift-tag](https://jml-gift-tag.herokuapp.com/).
